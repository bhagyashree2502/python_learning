#******CONTROL STATEMENTS*****************
# Control statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program.
# They help you decide what to execute, how many times, and when to skip or stop certain parts of code.
# Conditional statements >>(if,elif,else)
# if – checks the first condition

# elif – checks more conditions if previous ones are false

# else – runs when no conditions are true

# a program to check whether a person is adult or not
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")  # Runs if condition is True
else:
    print("You are a minor.")   # Runs if condition is False
